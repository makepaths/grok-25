## (Re)building for the Next Version of the Internet

Mark and Paul Johnson began designing and coding on the Internet together during the first era of the Internet — the dot-com boom — and never stopped. In 2012, they founded Pathwright, an education platform for teachers who care about designing great learning experiences. On the side, they advise on new products, teach design and code, <a href="https://www.chaosmap.io/">map chaos</a>, and answer questions about being twins (yes, they are twins). They're currently working a secret product for the next era of the Internet.
