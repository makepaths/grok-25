# Welcome to Day 1

Day 1 is here! We can't wait to see you.

Just in case you forgot, you can find us at 1 North Main St. We'll have Grok volunteers outside the building to direct you to the venue.

Take the elevators to get to the space (look for the "Clemson" button).

Stop by the registration table to pick up some swag. If you haven't registered yet, this is the time. After you're all checked in, grab some coffee, snacks, and a seat. Don't forget to make a friend.
