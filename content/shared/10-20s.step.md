# 10/20s: How-to

Now it's your turn! ❤️ Split off into your group for breakout sessions.

Constraint is a good thing. If the timer goes off before you've wrapped up your talk, that's ok! Find people to talk about this with at the next break or over dinner.

If you'd like to give a 10, but you're still not sure what to talk about, here are some questions to start you thinking:

What book are you reading and what do you like/dislike about it?

What is the hardest decision you've made this year?

What accomplishment are you most proud of at work this year?

What is your hobby and why do you love it?
