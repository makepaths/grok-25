Join us for the Grok Pre-registration Social at 6:30pm, held at Atlas Local:

Atlas Local, 25 Draper St., Greenville, SC 29611

You'll be able to check in for the event and receive your lanyard while meeting some of the other early birds and locals.

We'll serve beer, wine, some non-alcoholic beverages, and snacks. If you need more clarity about how to get around town, feel free to reach out to us at grok@atlaslocal.com.

We won't leave you hanging!
