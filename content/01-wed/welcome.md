# 10/20s

Grok is about starting conversations. There are specific times set aside during Grok where anyone can sign-up to give short talks called 10/20s.

You can sign-up to talk at the beginning of each session, so come prepared to share anything youâ€™re interested in getting feedback on (side projects, demos, something youâ€™ve learned,â€¦)

Come with a prepared talk or feel free to come up with one after hearing another speaker.
