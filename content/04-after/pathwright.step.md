# About Pathwright

Pathwright is a design tool for making any kind of Path for learning—an online course, team training, or an event like Grok.

Paths are everywhere, but they’re invisible, and as a result, often haphazard and unfocused. When what you're trying to learn is scattered over emails and documents, online platforms and zoom calls, it's easy to get lost.

Making a path visible makes it completable, replicable, and designable.

Do you (or anyone you know) need a more visible Path for training, teaching, coaching—or your own event? You can try out the current version of Pathwright today!
